Each address line is a pipe (|) separated list of addresses.  An address
may have an optional prefix.  Prefixes are used to color the address pin
on the map.  Recognized prefixes are:

	/^rest:  */	restaurant address, colored green
	/^last:  */	last delivery address, colored dark gray
	/^[1-9]\.  */	active delivery addresses, colored purple

Addresses w/o a recognized prefix are colored purple, even though they
may not be delievery desitionss.

Examples: 

1.	addr

	The simplest address line: 1 unprefixed address -> purple pin

2.	addr | addr ...

	A list of unprefixed addresses -> purple pins.

3.	rest: addr | 1. addr

	A simple pickup and delivery.  Two pins, rest: addr -> green, 1. addr ->
	purple

4.	rest: addr | 1. addr | 2. addr ...

	Pickup multiple orders at rest: addr and deliver them to 1. addr, 2. addr,
	etc.  The # numbers # are assigned in the order revieved whch is not
	neceissarily the # delivery order.

The "last: " address.  It can be useful to display the last destination
of the previous delivery.  This address is automatically extracted from the
log file and added as | last: addr # to the original address line:

5.	rest: addr | 1. addr | last: addr

	this will genearte 3 pins: rest: addr -> green, 1. addr -> purple and
	last: addr -> dark gray
